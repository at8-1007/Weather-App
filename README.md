# WeatherApp
This web project reports weather data of various cities from an XML file. The XML file contains various cities, a short description of the weather, and the high and low temperatures of each city. A DOM Parser is used to create a node tree based on the XML file and Java API is used to extract tree data to process and display to the user. This application allows the user to select a city via controls on a JSP page.

This project was an assignment for the course "XML: Design Paradigms" (605.644) in the Fall 2018 semester at Johns Hopkins University.
